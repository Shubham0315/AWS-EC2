# AWS-EC2
The project contains EC2, its types, Regions and Availability Zones in AWS with detailed practical on EC2 instance creation

- Most widely used and most popular AWS Service

Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
-
- Compute means we request AWS to provide compute instance which is combo of CPU, RAM and disk space. So we're basically asking AWS to provide Virtual Server. 
  - **Virtual Machine** :- Laptop is a physical server which we use. This laptop has to be used by multiple people. So we can install hypervisor on our physical machine and create logically isolated VMs so that other people can use laptop. Virtualization means using physical machines and hypervisors, share the machine across multiple people.
- AWS has multiple physical servers across world.
  When we request AWS for EC2 instance in specific region of the world (Asia pacific, Eu), it takes the request to hypervisor and gives us VM which is our EC2 instance.
- Cloud means AWS is public cloud platform. So EC2 is cloud compute instance we're getting.

- Elastic (many AWS services has this prefix) as any service can be scaled up and scaled down(increase resources/decrease them) Elastic in nature.
  - e.g:- EC2, EKS, ELB, EBS
- In short EC2 means give me Compute engine(VM) on my cloud platform which is elastic in nature
